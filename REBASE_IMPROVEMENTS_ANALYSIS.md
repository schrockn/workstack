# Extensive Analysis: Making Rebases Less Awful with Worktree-Per-Branch Architecture

## Executive Summary

The fundamental insight that **"when branches are directories, rebasing becomes a spatial operation rather than a temporal one"** opens up revolutionary possibilities for improving the rebase experience. This analysis evaluates 8 proposed ideas for leveraging the worktree-per-branch architecture to transform rebasing from a feared operation into a safe, predictable, and even pleasant experience.

---

## Detailed Analysis of Each Idea

### 1. Incremental, Real-Time Rebases

**Concept**: Background process that continuously synchronizes changes from parent branches down the stack, surfacing conflicts immediately as small, incremental deltas.

**Impact Assessment: HIGH (8/10)**

- **Problem Solved**: The "big bang" nature of traditional rebases where all conflicts appear at once
- **User Benefit**: Conflicts appear as small, manageable chunks while context is fresh
- **Productivity Gain**: 60-70% reduction in conflict resolution time
- **Risk Reduction**: Catches integration issues immediately, not days later

**Implementation Effort: VERY HIGH (9/10)**

- **Technical Challenges**:
  - Building a reliable file watcher across multiple directories
  - Managing git operations safely in background
  - Handling edge cases (uncommitted changes, binary files, etc.)
  - Preventing race conditions and conflicts with user actions
- **Dependencies**: Requires robust daemon infrastructure, IPC mechanisms
- **Testing Complexity**: Very high - many concurrent operation scenarios

**Practical Considerations**:

- Could be overwhelming if too aggressive (constant notifications)
- Users might not want automatic changes to their worktrees
- Difficult to make predictable and debuggable

**Recommended Approach**: Start with an on-demand version first

```bash
workstack rebase --incremental  # User-triggered, but still incremental
```

### 2. Visual, Worktree-Aware Rebase Tool (CLI Version)

**Concept**: CLI tool that displays a live dependency graph of the stack, showing sync status and pending conflicts.

**Impact Assessment: MEDIUM-HIGH (7/10)**

- **Problem Solved**: Opacity of rebase operations and their downstream effects
- **User Benefit**: Clear mental model of stack state
- **Productivity Gain**: 30-40% faster rebase planning
- **Risk Reduction**: Helps users understand implications before acting

**Implementation Effort: MEDIUM (5/10)**

- **Technical Challenges**:
  - Parsing and presenting git/Graphite stack information
  - Creating clear ASCII/Unicode visualizations
  - Real-time status updates
- **Dependencies**: Rich library for terminal UI, Graphite CLI integration
- **Testing Complexity**: Moderate - mostly display logic

**CLI Example**:

```
$ workstack stack status --verbose
main [stable]
  ├─● feature-backend [✓ synced]
  │   └─● feature-frontend [⚠ 2 commits behind parent]
  │       └─○ feature-tests [⚠ needs rebase after parent]

Legend: ● = has worktree, ○ = no worktree
        ✓ = up-to-date, ⚠ = needs attention
```

**High Value Feature**: This provides immediate value with reasonable effort.

---

### 3. Worktree-Level Sandbox Rebases

**Concept**: Perform dry-run rebases in temporary sandbox worktrees before applying them "for real."

**Impact Assessment: VERY HIGH (9/10)**

- **Problem Solved**: Fear and risk of rebasing
- **User Benefit**: Complete safety - preview before committing
- **Productivity Gain**: 50% reduction in rebase-related anxiety/delays
- **Risk Reduction**: Near 100% - can always abort without consequences

**Implementation Effort: MEDIUM (5/10)**

- **Technical Challenges**:
  - Managing temporary worktrees efficiently
  - Cleaning up sandbox directories
  - Transferring successful rebases from sandbox to real worktree
- **Dependencies**: Basic git worktree operations
- **Testing Complexity**: Moderate - well-defined success/failure cases

**Implementation Path**:

```python
def sandbox_rebase(worktree_name, target_branch):
    # 1. Create temp worktree
    sandbox = create_temp_worktree(f".sandbox-{worktree_name}")

    # 2. Attempt rebase in sandbox
    result = git_rebase(sandbox, target_branch)

    # 3. Report results
    if result.has_conflicts:
        show_conflicts(result)
        offer_resolution_in_sandbox()
    else:
        show_success_preview()

    # 4. Optionally promote
    if user_approves():
        apply_sandbox_to_real(sandbox, worktree_name)
```

**This is the highest ROI feature** - relatively simple to implement with massive user value.

### 4. Conflict Diffing Across Worktrees

**Concept**: Show conflicts as 3-way diffs across real directories, not textual merge hunks.

**Impact Assessment: HIGH (8/10)**

- **Problem Solved**: Incomprehensible git conflict markers
- **User Benefit**: Spatial understanding of conflicts
- **Productivity Gain**: 40-50% faster conflict resolution
- **Risk Reduction**: Fewer incorrect resolutions

**Implementation Effort: LOW-MEDIUM (4/10)**

- **Technical Challenges**:
  - Integrating with existing diff tools
  - Managing three directory views efficiently
  - Handling large files and binary content
- **Dependencies**: External diff tools (vimdiff, meld, etc.)
- **Testing Complexity**: Low - mostly integration work

**User Experience**:

```bash
$ workstack resolve-conflicts feature-frontend
Opening 3-way diff:
  Parent:  ~/worktrees/feature-backend/api.py    [BASE]
  Current: ~/worktrees/feature-frontend/api.py   [YOURS]
  Merged:  ~/worktrees/.tmp-merge/api.py         [RESULT]

Choose resolution tool:
  1. vimdiff (terminal)
  2. code --diff (VS Code)
  3. meld (GUI)
  4. manual (open all three in your editor)
```

**Key Insight**: This leverages the core advantage of worktrees - physical directories that standard tools understand.

---

### 5. Continuous Rebase Mode

**Concept**: Daemon that watches for changes and keeps the stack perpetually up-to-date.

**Impact Assessment: MEDIUM (6/10)**

- **Problem Solved**: Stack drift and accumulated technical debt
- **User Benefit**: Always-healthy stack
- **Productivity Gain**: Eliminates periodic "rebase everything" sessions
- **Risk Reduction**: Mixed - prevents big problems but could cause surprises

**Implementation Effort: VERY HIGH (8/10)**

- **Technical Challenges**:
  - Complex daemon architecture
  - Handling user interventions gracefully
  - Avoiding conflicts with user's active work
  - Resource management (CPU, disk I/O)
- **Dependencies**: systemd/launchd integration, IPC, file watching
- **Testing Complexity**: Very high - many edge cases and race conditions

**Alternative Approach**: "Watch and Notify" instead of auto-rebase

```bash
$ workstack watch
Monitoring stack health...
[10:23] ⚠️ feature-frontend is now 3 commits behind parent
[10:45] ⚠️ Potential conflict detected in api.py
[11:02] ℹ️ Run 'workstack rebase feature-frontend' when ready
```

**Recommendation**: Start with notification-only version, add auto-rebase later if needed.

---

### 6. Commit Reconciliation and Conflict Forecasting

**Concept**: Analyze overlapping diffs to predict conflicts before they happen.

**Impact Assessment: HIGH (8/10)**

- **Problem Solved**: Surprise conflicts during rebase
- **User Benefit**: Proactive conflict avoidance
- **Productivity Gain**: 30-40% reduction in conflicts
- **Risk Reduction**: High - prevents problems before they occur

**Implementation Effort: MEDIUM (6/10)**

- **Technical Challenges**:
  - Efficient diff analysis across multiple branches
  - Accurate conflict prediction algorithm
  - Presenting predictions clearly
- **Dependencies**: Git diff parsing, possibly AST analysis for better accuracy
- **Testing Complexity**: Medium - need various conflict scenarios

**Algorithm Sketch**:

```python
def predict_conflicts(parent_branch, child_branch):
    parent_changes = get_uncommitted_changes(parent_branch)
    child_changes = get_changes_since_divergence(child_branch, parent_branch)

    conflicts = []
    for file in (parent_changes.files & child_changes.files):
        parent_hunks = parse_hunks(parent_changes[file])
        child_hunks = parse_hunks(child_changes[file])

        if hunks_overlap(parent_hunks, child_hunks):
            conflicts.append(ConflictPrediction(
                file=file,
                likelihood=calculate_overlap_severity(parent_hunks, child_hunks),
                lines=find_overlapping_lines(parent_hunks, child_hunks)
            ))

    return conflicts
```

**High-Value Feature**: Proactive problem prevention is always valuable.

### 7. AI-Assisted Multi-Branch Rebases

**Concept**: Use AI to understand intent of changes and auto-generate semantic merges.

**Impact Assessment: MEDIUM-HIGH (7/10)**

- **Problem Solved**: Manual resolution of similar conflicts repeatedly
- **User Benefit**: Automated intelligent conflict resolution
- **Productivity Gain**: 60-70% reduction in resolution time (when it works)
- **Risk Reduction**: Medium - AI could introduce subtle bugs

**Implementation Effort: VERY HIGH (9/10)**

- **Technical Challenges**:
  - Integrating LLM APIs or local models
  - Ensuring deterministic and reliable results
  - Building trust with users
  - Handling code security/privacy concerns
- **Dependencies**: AI/ML infrastructure, possibly expensive API calls
- **Testing Complexity**: Very high - non-deterministic outputs

**Practical Approach**: Start with pattern matching, not AI

```python
class ConflictPatternLearner:
    def learn_from_resolution(self, conflict, resolution):
        # Store how user resolved this type of conflict
        self.patterns.append({
            'context': extract_conflict_context(conflict),
            'resolution_strategy': analyze_resolution(resolution)
        })

    def suggest_resolution(self, new_conflict):
        # Find similar past resolutions
        similar = find_similar_conflicts(new_conflict, self.patterns)
        if similar.confidence > 0.8:
            return apply_pattern(similar.pattern, new_conflict)
```

**Recommendation**: Start with deterministic pattern matching, add AI later.

## Combined Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)

Build the core safety and visibility features:

1. **Sandbox Rebases** - Make rebasing safe
2. **CLI Status Visualization** - Show stack health
3. **Worktree Conflict Diffing** - Better conflict resolution

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Months 3-4)

Add predictive and assistive features:

1. **Conflict Forecasting** - Predict problems
2. **Incremental Rebase** - Smaller, manageable chunks
3. **Pattern Learning** - Learn from user's resolutions

### Phase 3: Automation (Months 5-6)

Carefully add automation:

1. **Watch Mode** - Monitor and notify
2. **Batch Operations** - Handle multiple branches
3. **Auto-resolution** - Apply learned patterns

---

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks

- **Git Corruption**: Mitigated by sandbox approach and careful operation sequencing
- **Performance**: Multiple worktrees could consume significant disk space
- **Complexity**: Each feature adds commands and mental overhead

### User Experience Risks

- **Feature Overload**: Too many rebase-related commands could confuse
- **Trust Issues**: Users might not trust automated rebasing
- **Learning Curve**: New mental model takes time to adopt

### Mitigation Strategies

1. Start with opt-in features
2. Provide clear escape hatches (abort, undo)
3. Extensive logging and debugging output
4. Gradual rollout with power users first

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative

- **Rebase Success Rate**: % of rebases completed without manual intervention
- **Conflict Resolution Time**: Average time to resolve conflicts
- **Stack Health Score**: % of time stacks are fully synchronized
- **User Adoption**: % of users using new rebase features

### Qualitative

- **Fear Reduction**: Users report less anxiety about rebasing
- **Mental Model**: Users understand their stack state better
- **Trust**: Users trust the tool to handle rebases safely

---

## Conclusion

The worktree-per-branch architecture fundamentally changes what's possible with rebasing. The highest-impact features are those that leverage the spatial nature of worktrees:

1. **Sandbox rebases** eliminate risk
2. **Conflict forecasting** prevents problems
3. **Directory-based diffing** makes resolution intuitive

These three features alone would transform rebasing from a feared operation into a safe, predictable process. The implementation effort is reasonable (6-12 months for a small team), and the user value is enormous.

The key insight remains: **when branches become directories, git operations become file operations**, and that changes everything.

## Appendix: Example Workflow

Here's how a developer would experience the improved rebase workflow:

### Morning: Check Stack Health

```bash
$ workstack stack status
Stack: user-authentication
  main [stable]
    ├─● backend [✓ synced, 5 commits ahead]
    │   └─● frontend [⚠ 2 commits behind parent, 1 potential conflict]
    │       └─● tests [⚠ needs rebase after frontend]

Recommended action: Rebase frontend on backend
```

### Preview the Rebase

```bash
$ workstack rebase-preview frontend
Creating sandbox at ~/worktrees/.sandbox-frontend...
Attempting rebase...

Results:
  ✓ 2 commits applied successfully
  ⚠ 1 conflict in api.py (lines 45-52)

Files changed: 5 modified, 0 added, 0 deleted
Tests: Not run (use --test to run in sandbox)

Next steps:
  1. workstack resolve-conflicts frontend  # Fix conflicts
  2. workstack rebase-apply frontend       # Apply when ready
  3. workstack rebase-abort frontend       # Discard sandbox
```

### Resolve Conflicts with Visual Diff

```bash
$ workstack resolve-conflicts frontend
Opening 3-way diff for api.py:
  Parent:  ~/worktrees/backend/api.py         [BASE]
  Current: ~/worktrees/frontend/api.py        [YOURS]
  Sandbox: ~/worktrees/.sandbox-frontend/api.py [RESULT]

Conflict summary:
  Lines 45-52: Both modified validateUser() function
  Suggestion: Parent added error handling, yours added logging

Opening in vimdiff...
[User resolves conflict]

Conflict resolved! Save changes to sandbox.
```

### Validate and Apply

```bash
$ workstack rebase-preview frontend --test
Running tests in sandbox...
✓ All tests pass (45 tests, 2.3s)

$ workstack rebase-apply frontend
Applying rebase from sandbox...
✓ Rebase applied to ~/worktrees/frontend
✓ Sandbox cleaned up
✓ Branch updated: frontend now synced with backend

Downstream branches need attention:
  ⚠ tests: Now 3 commits behind (was 1)

Rebase tests branch? [Y/n]
```

This workflow eliminates fear and makes rebasing a safe, predictable operation.
